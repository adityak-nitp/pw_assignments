    "### Q3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "Ans-Yes, Python is case sensitive. It treats uppercase and lowercase character differently.This is applicable for identifiers. Same name with different cases must be avoided while naming identifiers. for example, if we have to store counts of values, we should name the variables count1 and count2 instead of naming the C and c."

    "### Q14. How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "Ans - Memory allocation can be defined as allocating a block of space in the computer memory to a program.In Python, memory management is performed automatically by the Python memory manager, which is a component of the Python interpreter. The memory manager handles the allocation and freeing of memory by Python objects and data structures, as well as the management of memory used by Python itself. Python uses a technique called reference counting to keep track of the number of references to an object, and when the reference count reaches zero, the memory occupied by that object is automatically freed. The memory manager also employs a garbage collector, which periodically frees up memory occupied by unreachable objects."
